## 🌏 About Me

Based in the 🇵🇭 Philippines, I've worked with US clients across multiple industries — always delivering high-quality work at competitive rates. I'm the type of dev who goes deep: whether it's optimizing your frontend load time, cleaning up your backend logic, or building automation to save your team hours each week.

I'm also a strong believer in **partnering** with my clients — not just coding tasks, but understanding the bigger picture.
